I'm a master's student in Electrical Engineering at [University of São Paulo (USP)](https://www5.usp.br/) under the supervision of [Miguel Ramírez](http://www.lps.usp.br/miguel/). My research interests lies in the field of representation learning, generative modeling and semi-supervised learning applied to speech and language processing (SLP).

I'm also a senior data scientist at [Itaú-Unibanco](https://www.itau.com.br/). Previously, I was a data scientist intern at [General Electric](https://www.ge.com/research/), and an undergraduate research assistant at [Brazilian Center for Research in Physics](https://portal.cbpf.br/en-us/home/) working on image processing.

For more details, please take a look at my [CV]() (last update: 2021/02/21).

Apart from my professional interests, I like to practice Wushu (lineage: **Wu Ji Tang Lang Men**) and I enjoy the **Beat Generation** literary movement, mainly the works of Kerouac, Ginsberg and Cassady.
